NewEdge Wealth chief investment officer Cameron Dawson tells Morning Brief co-hosts Seana Smith and Brad Smith this lag is due in part to investors' waning patience with Big Tech's massive spending on artificial intelligence (AI) without seeing a payoff from the investments. Dawson says the new DeepSeek model has sparked questions about Big Tech's spending. There's ""a question about the efficacy of CapEx growth within the US tech complex. One of the things is that we've seen huge CapEx spending by the Mag Seven, which, of course, has benefited other Mag Seven names. Are we starting to get to the point where investors are losing patience with this degree of CapEx spending?"" The Mag Seven ""has lagged as we've gone into 2025, and we think it's because investors are starting to ask the question: What is the return on invested capital for all of this spending that they're doing?

21,AMZN,"Wed, 12 Feb 2025 12:48:52 +0000","Amazon (AMZN) is one of the ""Magnificent 7"" components managing to cling to gains this year, eclipsed only by Meta (META). The rest of the closely followed group is down, led by a plunge in Tesla (TSLA). The gains on Amazon are interesting given how much it plans to spend on capex this year. Similar to Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta this earnings season, Amazon recently uncorked a whopper of a capital spending guide. It sees $104 billion in capital expenditures this year, well above analyst forecasts of $80 billion to $85 billion going into its earnings reports. The Street has opted to stay bullish on Amazon after its results and surprising guidance for two reasons. Most analysts have pointed to a sales reacceleration in the key Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud business later this year amid the company's aggressive spending. And two, the company is driving a good bit of efficiency out of its bread-and-butter retail network. But can the bullishness on Amazon be sustained?

NewEdge Wealth chief investment officer Cameron Dawson tells Morning Brief co-hosts Seana Smith and Brad Smith this lag is due in part to investors' waning patience with Big Tech's massive spending on artificial intelligence (AI) without seeing a payoff from the investments. Dawson says the new DeepSeek model has sparked questions about Big Tech's spending. There's ""a question about the efficacy of CapEx growth within the US tech complex. One of the things is that we've seen huge CapEx spending by the Mag Seven, which, of course, has benefited other Mag Seven names. Are we starting to get to the point where investors are losing patience with this degree of CapEx spending?"" The Mag Seven ""has lagged as we've gone into 2025, and we think it's because investors are starting to ask the question: What is the return on invested capital for all of this spending that they're doing? We're seeing a lot more competition within AI, which is very much in contrast with these near-monopoly businesses that [are] the core bread and butter of the Mag Seven.""

Dawson says the new DeepSeek model has sparked questions about Big Tech's spending. There's ""a question about the efficacy of CapEx growth within the US tech complex.

The rest of the closely followed group is down, led by a plunge in Tesla (TSLA). The gains on Amazon are interesting given how much it plans to spend on capex this year. Similar to Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta this earnings season, Amazon recently uncorked a whopper of a capital spending guide. It sees $104 billion in capital expenditures this year, well above analyst forecasts of $80 billion to $85 billion going into its earnings reports. The Street has opted to stay bullish on Amazon after its results and surprising guidance for two reasons. Most analysts have pointed to a sales reacceleration in the key Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud business later this year amid the company's aggressive spending. And two, the company is driving a good bit of efficiency out of its bread-and-butter retail network. But can the bullishness on Amazon be sustained?

The iPhone developer is reportedly partnering with Alibaba (BABA) to further expands its artificial intelligence (AI) strategy, according to a report by The Information. TECHnalysis Research president Bob O'Donnell discusses on Asking for a Trend how the iPhone SE, with its smaller form factor and lower price, appeals to customers who prefer compact devices. ""The [iPhone] SE has never been a huge part of the iPhone market in terms of a percentage, but there is a very distinct group of people who just don't really like huge phones. And, the SE has served that market,"" O'Donnell says. While the SE may not drive massive sales, it serves a niche market, particularly in emerging regions where its affordability is key. O'Donnell comments on Apple's new AI partnership with Alibaba as the tech giant seeks to further penetrate China's consumer tech market: ""This is something that we knew had to be coming, not necessarily with Alibaba. But in order for Apple to bring Apple intelligence to China they were going to have to find a Chinese partner, and it's well known that Chinese consumers are very interested in AI capabilities.""

NewEdge Wealth chief investment officer Cameron Dawson tells Morning Brief co-hosts Seana Smith and Brad Smith this lag is due in part to investors' waning patience with Big Tech's massive spending on artificial intelligence (AI) without seeing a payoff from the investments. Dawson says the new DeepSeek model has sparked questions about Big Tech's spending. There's ""a question about the efficacy of CapEx growth within the US tech complex. One of the things is that we've seen huge CapEx spending by the Mag Seven, which, of course, has benefited other Mag Seven names. Are we starting to get to the point where investors are losing patience with this degree of CapEx spending?"" The Mag Seven ""has lagged as we've gone into 2025, and we think it's because investors are starting to ask the question: What is the return on invested capital for all of this spending that they're doing? We're seeing a lot more competition within AI, which is very much in contrast with these near-monopoly businesses that [are] the core bread and butter of the Mag Seven.""
