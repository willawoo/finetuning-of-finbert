""This is pretty much mainstream antitrust merger enforcement,"" Baer explains. ""It is not something that's out of left field."" He points out that if the deal proceeds, the combined companies would control ""well over 70% of the US market."" Under antitrust law, he argues, this would be considered ""unlawful"" and ""problematic."" While acknowledging that the merger would save each company significant money and potentially enhance efficiency, Baer emphasizes the broader competitive implications. ""It doesn't mean consumers and the businesses that buy from these two companies are going to do better,"" he says. ""And that's really what antitrust is all about: separating what is beneficial to shareholders but may be bad for competition.""

1129,TGT,2025-01-29 18:30:00,"Amid ongoing tariffs and immigration uncertainty, investors need to adjust their strategies to navigate shifting risks. JoAnne Feeney, Partner and Portfolio Manager at Advisors Capital Management, joins Wealth host Brad Smith to advise that investors should focus on companies with a strong domestic presence to navigate tariff impacts. “One way to work around that is to try to own companies that are more domestically focused, that aren't so heavily reliant on an international supply chain, Feeney says. ""That's kind of hard to do. We're a pretty global economy, but still there are places that one can go... And also to find companies that will be more resilient if the consumer is particularly hard hit by these tariffs, which will raise their prices. Feeney suggests that resilient retailers, like TJ Maxx (TJX) and Target (TGT), may be better positioned to withstand price hikes caused by tariffs. Additionally, Feeney highlights the importance of considering the long-term growth potential of technology stocks, which, despite recent volatility, remain a solid option for diversifying portfolios.

""That's kind of hard to do. We're a pretty global economy, but still there are places that one can go... And also to find companies that will be more resilient if the consumer is particularly hard hit by these tariffs, which will raise their prices. Feeney suggests that resilient retailers, like TJ Maxx (TJX) and Target (TGT), may be better positioned to withstand price hikes caused by tariffs.
